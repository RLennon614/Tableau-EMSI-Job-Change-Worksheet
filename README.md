📈 UK Job Change Analysis (EMSI Data)
📝 Overview
This repository hosts a data analysis project focused on understanding job change and labor market shifts across various industries in the United Kingdom. The project utilizes data derived from EMSI (Economic Modeling Specialists International), which is segmented by industry classification codes. The analysis aims to identify sectors experiencing the most significant growth or decline.

This project demonstrates skills in handling, joining, analyzing, and visualizing economic data.

💾 Project Data Sources
The analysis relies on the following CSV files, which contain UK employment data typically classified using Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes:

EMSI_JobChange_UK (1).xlsx - 1 digit.csv: Contains job change data aggregated at the highest level of industry classification (1-digit SIC/NAICS equivalent). This provides a high-level overview of large economic sectors (e.g., Manufacturing, Services, Finance).

EMSI_JobChange_UK (1).xlsx - 2 digit.csv: Contains more granular job change data classified at the 2-digit level. This provides detailed insights into sub-sectors within the broader economic categories.

✨ Key Analysis Skills Demonstrated
The project leverages Excel (or a similar tool) to perform the following types of analysis on the job change data:

I. Data Preparation
Data Joining/Linking (Implied): If the data was originally separate, techniques were used to link or combine the 1-digit and 2-digit level data for comprehensive reporting.

Data Cleaning: Ensuring consistency and accuracy in the job change metrics and industry codes.

II. Calculations & Metrics
Absolute Change: Calculating the total number of jobs gained or lost within a specific time frame.

Percentage Change: Determining the rate of growth or decline for each industry sector.

Ranking: Identifying the top 5 fastest-growing and fastest-declining sectors based on both absolute and percentage change.

III. Visualization & Reporting
Comparative Charts: Using Bar Charts or Column Charts to visually compare job change across the different 1-digit sectors.

Trend Analysis: Potentially visualizing job change over multiple years (if time-series data is present).

Detailed Sector Focus: Using the 2-digit data to drill down and visualize performance within specific, granular industries.

🚀 How to View the Project
